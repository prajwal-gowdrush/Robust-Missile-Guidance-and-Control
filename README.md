# Robust-Missile-Guidance-and-Control
MainScript_OnlyProNav_.m, MainScript_Project_CtrllrDesign.m, MainScript_Project_ObserverDesign.m are the matlab files to be run (in that order).

An output-feedback flight control system is designed and integrated within a guidance law to model an air-to-air intercept scenario. The autopilot is systematically tuned to
minimize miss distance while meeting certain robustness specifications. Refer 'Project_Report_Robust_Missile_Guidance_and_Control' for more details.
